description: CIM 2024 Race Reflection
---
Having finished CIM 2024 recently, I thought it would be best to reflect on the race with things I did well and could improve on. With this, I found this list of questions from [leagendersfitness](https://www.leagendersfitness.com/news/post-race-reflections-and-performance-analysis) and thought it would be nice to answer all of them as a way to reflect.

1. Race Date / Distance
CIM 2024 (26.2 miles)

2. Estimated finish time vs. actual finish time
I was going for sub-4 hours but ended up finishing in 4:04:23.

3. What were your splits? What do your mile splits show you about your pacing strategy?
Splits were hovering around 9:00 min/mile for the 1st 20 miles or so but the wheels fell off the last 10k. I definitely went out too fast in the beginning even though I knew I shouldn't have.

4. How was the weather?
Weather was cool in the early start of the race and heated up a little bit in the 2nd half.

5. How was the course? (Hilly, flat, multi-surface, crowds, race support, etc.)
The 1st half of the course was quite hilly with a steady flat course the 2nd half. Crowd energy was amazing throughout.

5. Were there any factors that were out of your control that impacted your results?
Not in particular

6. Were you able to handle uncontrollable or unexpected obstacles?
Other than cramping I think I handled things pretyy well

7. Were you able to stabilize emotions? 
Yes, I was freaking out a little bit when I started cramping around mile 20, but was just determined to keep pushing on and tried not to walk.

8. What was your fueling and hydration plan during the race? Did it go as expected? Any room for improvement? 
My plan was to take a Precision gel (30g of carbs) every 30 minutes so ingesting about 60g of carbs an hour. In hindsight, I think I can should've gone for more, maybe 80g of carbs but in training I had only taken up to 60g. For hydration, I had 2 flasks of electrolyte-enhanced water and sipped it about every mile or so. After running out of water the 2nd half, I started taking water from the aid stations. Every 45 minutes or so I also took a Salt Stick electrolyte pill.

9. Did you finish the race as expected, worse than expected, or better than expected? In other words, did your performance accurately reflect your training?
Slightly worse than expected, I was shooting for sub-4 but didn't quite hit the mark. In hindsight, I should've trained at a slightly faster pace than what my actual goal was. So maybe about 8:55-9:00 training for a sub-4 (9:09) since that would have led to a slightly better running economy for a sub-4.

10. If better than expected, highlight all the positives that worked in your favor. 
I didn't perform better than expected :(

11. What do you believe is the reason you performed better than expected?
I didn't

12. How can you leverage those positives in future races? 
:(

13. If worse than expected, what worked against you?
Definitely not doing enough strength training the latter parts of the marathon training block and not doing enough long runs on rolling hills. I think my legs weren't used to the constant pounding of the downhills.

14. What do you believe is the reason you performed worse than expected?
Same as 13

15. What can you do differently (if anything) to avoid this outcome in your next race? 
Strength train at least once a week in the latter stages of the training block and do more longs runs on rolling hills

16. What makes you most proud about this race?
Even though I didn't hit my goal of a sub-4 hour marathon, I still finished a marathon, something I didn't expect at the beginning of the year when I was contemplating whether or not to even do one!

17. What was your mindset like during this race? Did your thoughts and feelings help or harm your overall performance?  Is there room to improve your mental training? 
I stayed positive throughout the entire race, and tried to stay strong mentally when I started cramping around mile 20. My focus was just to keep moving even though I was going slower and opted not to walk to keep some momentum at least.

18. How was your sleep in the days leading up to race day? Is there room for improvement in future training cycles?
Sleep was ok for the most part, got a decent 7-8 hours

19. How was your stress levels leading up to race day? Is it necessary to implant strategies to lower overall stress? 
Stress levels were fine

20. What did you eat in the week leading up to the race? Do you think this helped or harmed your overall performance? 
A lot of pasta, rice, and noodles in general. I would like to thing the amount of carbs I was eating was helping but in the end, I don't know eating more would've helped with the cramping near the end of the race.

21. What would you do differently in your training or on race day to improve performance in the future? 
- Strength train at least once a week in the latter stages of the training block
- Do more longs runs on rolling hills
- Smarter pacing strategy where I actually go out slower in the beginning so I can ramp up pace at the end

22. Where is your most significant opportunity for improvement? What is one factor you could you have done better that would bring the best results in future races.
- Smarter pacing, strength training, rolling hill long runs
