description: Why I'm Starting to Write
---

This blog has been a lot time coming. I've always wanted a place to write down whatever I'm thinking or learning about but have always either been too lazy or hesistant. Other than this, I wanted to start writing for a couple of other reasons:
- Every day my mind is always wandering and thoughts come upon my mind but I haven't really acted on them or tried to write them down in any way. This leads to these thoughts fleeting and maybe forgotten forever... I want to be more active now in what thoughts come across my mind and to note them to remember them in case I have a use for them in the future.
- Communication has never been my strong suit, especially in being able to express my own thoughts. This is a skill I want to hone as it will be necessary for both my personal and professional life. I don't want this to be a weakness as I grow older.
- There are other reasons that I can't remember for now, but will update this post as I remember them.
